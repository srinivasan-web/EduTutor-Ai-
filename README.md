2. Project Overview
EduTutor AI is an educational assistant built with the Granite LLM from Hugging Face.
It provides personalized learning experiences through:
ÔÇ∑üìò Concept Explanation (detailed breakdowns with examples)
ÔÇ∑üìù Quiz Generator (MCQ, True/False, and short answers with solutions)
The project runs seamlessly in Google Colab for low setup effort and reliable performance, making it easy to deploy and extend with new features.

4. Architecture
ÔÇ∑Frontend: Gradio interface with tabs for concept explanation and quiz generation.
ÔÇ∑Backend: Hugging Face Transformers + IBM Granite Model for inference.
ÔÇ∑Deployment: Google Colab for runtime environment and live public links.
ÔÇ∑Version Control: GitHub for hosting code and documentation.
Flow:
1.User inputs a topic or concept.
2.Hugging Face Granite LLM processes the input.
3.Response is generated (explanation or quiz).
4.Output displayed in Gradio UI.
5. Technologies Used:
- IBM Granite Model (via Hugging Face Transformers)
 - Hugging Face transformers library
 - PyTorch (torch) for model execution
 - Gradio for interactive UI
 - Google Colab for deployment
 - GitHub for project hosting
5. Setup Instructions & Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/edututor-ai-granite.git
   cd edututor-ai-granite

2. Install dependencies:
   pip install torch transformers gradio

3. Run the application:
   python app.py

4. Launch in browser:
   A local URL will be provided or use share=True for public Colab link.
6. Folder Structure & Process
‚Ä¢ app.py ‚Äì Main application script.
‚Ä¢ requirements.txt ‚Äì Dependencies list.
‚Ä¢ notebook.ipynb ‚Äì Google Colab notebook.
‚Ä¢ docs/ ‚Äì Project documentation.
‚Ä¢ screenshots/ ‚Äì UI screenshots.
‚Ä¢ .gitignore ‚Äì Git ignore file.

8. Running the Application

- **Option 1:** Run locally with Python ‚Üí http://localhost:7860
- **Option 2:** Run in Google Colab ‚Üí Generates a `gradio.live` public link.
- Select the desired tab (Concept Explanation or Quiz Generator).
- Input a topic and view the generated outputs.
8. API Documentation
EduTutor AI is packaged as a Gradio app but can be extended with APIs:
- **POST /concept-explanation** ‚Üí Input: {"concept": "Machine Learning"}, Output: Explanation.
- **POST /quiz-generator** ‚Üí Input: {"topic": "LLM"}, Output: Quiz questions with answers.
9. Authentication
¬∑  Simple token-based access control.
¬∑  Best for server-to-server or internal API use.
¬∑  Easily revocable or regeneratable if compromised.
¬∑  Can be IP-restricted or scoped to certain endpoints.
¬∑  Enables secure third-party access without exposing user credentials.
¬∑  Suitable for role-based systems (e.g., admin vs student access in LMS).
¬∑  10. User Interface
- Two main tabs in Gradio:
1. **Concept Explanation**: Input ‚Üí AI-generated explanation.
2. **Quiz Generator**: Input ‚Üí AI-generated quiz + answers.
- Clean layout with Markdown headers.
- Shareable link for remote learners.
11. Testing
- **Unit Testing:** Functions like `generate_response`, `concept_explanation`, and `quiz_generator`.
- **Integration Testing:** Full Gradio UI workflow
- **Edge Cases:** Long input prompts, empty fields, unsupported topics.

13. Known Issues
‚Ä¢ Response length may sometimes exceed expectations.
‚Ä¢ Limited control over question variety.
‚Ä¢ Requires internet connection for Hugging Face model loading.
14.Future Enhancements
- *LMS Integration:** Connect with Moodle/Canvas for personalized student progress.
-  **Voice Support:** Speech-to-text for easier accessibility.
-  **Teacher Dashboard:** Track student quiz performance.
- **Expanded Subjects:** Add more structured datasets for domain-specific quizzes.
